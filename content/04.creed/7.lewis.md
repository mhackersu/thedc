# Commentary on C.S. Lewis in Relation to Valentinianism and Early Christian Thought

## Overview
C.S. Lewis (1898–1963), a British scholar and Christian apologist, wrote extensively on themes of good and evil, the incarnation, and spiritual formation. His works offer modern readers a bridge between classical Christian theology and the mythopoeic imagination—making him a compelling counterpoint to ancient Gnostic systems like Valentinianism.

## Key Concepts Relevant to the Discussion

### 1. **Incarnation and the Goodness of Creation**
Lewis, especially in *Mere Christianity* and *The Problem of Pain*, defends the Incarnation as God's ultimate affirmation of the physical world.

**Contrast with Valentinianism:**
- Valentinians denied the full humanity of Christ and often embraced Docetism (that Jesus only appeared to be human).
- Lewis asserts that Jesus' bodily incarnation and resurrection are central to the Christian faith and point to a redeemed materiality.
- In *The Screwtape Letters*, Lewis emphasizes the spiritual value of embodied life and daily choices, directly opposing the escapist tendencies of Gnostic thought.

### 2. **Myth Made Fact**
In his essay *Myth Became Fact*, Lewis explains how Christianity, unlike mythologies, is the true myth that entered history.

**Application:**
- Gnostics valued myth and symbolic knowledge but often disconnected it from historical reality.
- Lewis insists on Christianity’s rootedness in history—specifically the historical birth, death, and resurrection of Christ.

### 3. **The Problem of Evil and Love**
Lewis wrestles with suffering and evil, not by denying the goodness of creation, but by highlighting God’s refining love.

**Key Texts:**
- *The Problem of Pain* (intellectual wrestling)
- *A Grief Observed* (experiential wrestling)
- Emphasizes God's role as a loving Father rather than a distant or flawed creator—a counter-image to the Gnostic demiurge.

## Summary
C.S. Lewis stands in firm opposition to the dualism and secret elitism of Valentinian Gnosticism. His works affirm the reality and goodness of creation, the historicity and fullness of the Incarnation, and the accessibility of God’s truth to all—echoing the apostolic faith defended by the early Church.
