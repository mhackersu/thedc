# Valentinianism

## Overview

**Valentinianism** is a major branch of **Gnosticism**, founded by **Valentinus** (c. 100–160 AD), an early Christian teacher from Egypt who nearly became a bishop in Rome. His teachings attempted to blend **Christian doctrine** with **platonic philosophy** and **mystical cosmology**, claiming access to secret knowledge (*gnosis*) about divine realities.

## Key Beliefs

### 1. **The Pleroma ("Fullness")**
- The divine realm, inhabited by a hierarchy of **30 Aeons** (heavenly beings).
- The Aeons are emanations from the **invisible, unknowable God**.
- **Sophia (Wisdom)**, one of the lower Aeons, attempts to know the unknowable Father, causing a cosmic fracture.

### 2. **The Fall and Creation of the Material World**
- Sophia's fall results in a flawed spiritual being: the **Demiurge** (often identified with the God of the Old Testament).
- The Demiurge ignorantly creates the **material world**, which is viewed as corrupt and a prison for spiritual beings.
- Humanity is created as a mix of **spirit, soul, and matter**.

### 3. **Jesus and Salvation**
- **Christ** is sent from the higher Pleroma to bring **gnosis** and liberate the spiritual seed (pneumatics) within humans.
- Jesus only **appeared** to be human (**Docetism**)—he was not truly incarnate.
- Salvation comes not by faith or works, but through **secret knowledge** revealed to the elite.

## Types of People in Valentinian Thought

1. **Pneumatics** – spiritual people who can receive gnosis and are destined for return to the Pleroma.
2. **Psychics** – ordinary believers (e.g., mainstream Christians), who may achieve a lesser salvation.
3. **Hylics** – material people, bound to the flesh and destined for destruction.

## Valentinus's Influence

- Taught in **Alexandria** and later in **Rome**.
- Had many disciples and sub-sects (Eastern and Western Valentinians).
- Nearly elected bishop in Rome—indicates how close this heresy came to gaining mainstream influence.

## Rejection by the Early Church

- Strongly refuted by **Irenaeus** in *Against Heresies* (~180 AD).
- Also opposed by **Tertullian**, **Hippolytus**, and later **Epiphanius**.
- Rejected for:
  - Denying the **true incarnation** of Christ
  - Elitism and **secret knowledge**
  - Distortion of **creation theology**
  - Rejection of **bodily resurrection** and apostolic teaching

## Scriptural Conflicts (KJV References)

- **Incarnation**:  
  > "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us..." — *John 1:14*

- **Creator God**:  
  > "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." — *Genesis 1:1*

- **Equality in salvation**:  
  > "There is neither Jew nor Greek... for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." — *Galatians 3:28*

- **Salvation by grace, not secret knowledge**:  
  > "For by grace are ye saved through faith..." — *Ephesians 2:8*

## Summary

Valentinianism was a highly intellectual and seductive heresy that mimicked Christian language but radically altered its meanings. It introduced a **cosmic drama**, **secret rituals**, and an **elitist spiritual hierarchy**. Its ultimate failure helped clarify early Christian doctrine on **creation, incarnation, and salvation**.
